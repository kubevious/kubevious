# What is Kubevious Dashboard?
**Kubevious Dashboard** (pronounced [kju:bvi:…ôs]) is an app-centric assurance, validation, and introspection platform for Kubernetes. It helps running modern Kubernetes applications without disasters, and costly outages by continuously validating application manifests, cluster state and configuration. Kubevious detects and prevents errors(_typos, misconfigurations, conflicts, inconsistencies_) and violations of best practices. Our secret sauce is based on the ability to validate across multiple manifests and looking at the configuration from the application vantage point. Kubevious' unique app-centric user interface delivers intuitive insight, introspection and troubleshooting tools for cloud-native applications. It works right out of the box and only takes a couple of minutes to get Kubevious up and running for existing production applications. Kubevious operates inside the cluster with the user interface accessible as a web app and a CLI tool for integration with CI/CD pipelines.

# üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Running Kubevious Dashboard
Kubevious consists of the following three projects that can be used together as well as independently, depending on the use case.

## üî≠ Running Kubevious Dashboard Inside the Cluster
Kubevious works with any Kubernetes distribution and runs within the cluster. Deploy using Helm v3.2+:

```sh
kubectl create namespace kubevious

helm repo add kubevious https://helm.kubevious.io

helm upgrade --atomic -i kubevious kubevious/kubevious --version 1.2.1 -n kubevious

kubectl port-forward service/kubevious-ui-clusterip 8080:80 -n kubevious
```
Access from browser: http://localhost:8080

For more details on installation options, visit [Deployment Repository](https://github.com/kubevious/helm).

## üõª Running Kubevious Portable - Outside the Cluster
While **Kubevious** was made to run inside the cluster and monitor the cluster it lives in, **[Kubevious Portable](https://github.com/kubevious/portable)** version runs outside the cluster. Usually, that would happen on development machines from where operators would run *kubectl* commands. Kubevious Portable runs inside a single docker container. Kubevious Portable does not have Rule Executing and Time Machine capabilities and is meant for quick sanity check and visualization of Kubernetes clusters and applications. Kubevious Portable connects to clusters defined in kube-config files. See instructions on [running Kubevious Portable here](https://github.com/kubevious/portable#running-kubevious-portable).

# ‚ÑπÔ∏è What can you do with Kubevious?

## ‚úÖ Validate
Kubevious continuously validates cluster configuration and state for misconfigurations, typos, and violations of best practices. 

- <a href="https://kubevious.io/docs/built-in-validators/" target="_blank">Built-in Validations</a> include a comprehensive library of rules to detect and prevent DevOps/SRE focused misconfigurations.

- <a href="https://kubevious.io/docs/features/rules-engine/" target="_blank">Rules Engine</a> provides an intuitive policy language for custom extensions of validation logic using a JavaScript-like if-then-else syntax. **Rules Engine** allows enforcement of complex cross-manifest policies.

## üëÅÔ∏è Observe
Kubevious analyses Kubernetes cluster configuration and state and presents it graphically into multiple domain-focused views. You can learn more about Kubevious UI <a href="https://kubevious.io/docs/features/application-centric-ui/" target="_blank">
here
</a>.

- **Logic View** is focused on app-centricity, where container, compute, networking, storage, and RBAC related manifests correlated and grouped under Application nodes.
- **Image View** is focused on container images and container image repositories used in the cluster.
- **Gateway View** provides visibility regarding how applications are exposed to the public using Ingresses and API Gateways.
- **RBAC View** identifies how Users and Groups are used in the cluster.
- **Package View** provides visibility to Helm charts installed in the Kubernetes cluster.

## üî¨ Introspect
Kubevious provides insights optimized for specific roles and responsibilities as well as correlated app-centric views.

- <a href="https://kubevious.io/docs/features/cloud-native-tools/correlated-rbac/" target="_blank">Correlated RBAC</a>. Understand which permissions are granted to Applications through ServiceAccounts, RoleBindings, and Roles.
![Kubevious Correlated RBAC](https://kubevious.io/static/553c48aa1fb6426d57c9d51996a4a371/3f20e/selected-service-account.png)

- <a href="https://kubevious.io/docs/features/cloud-native-tools/correlated-network-policies/" target="_blank">Correlated Network Policies</a>. Understand how NetworkPolicies are affecting applications and which traffic is allowed.
![Kubevious Network Policies Correlated](https://kubevious.io/static/ca9090ba03b8fd0b4d73fe1b7466cf29/3f20e/network-policies.png)

- <a href="https://kubevious.io/docs/features/cloud-native-tools/identifying-blast-radius/" target="_blank">Identifying Blast Radius</a>. Identify shared resources within the cluster.

- <a href="https://kubevious.io/docs/features/cloud-native-tools/radioactive-workloads/" target="_blank">Radioactive Workloads</a>. Identify applications that have excessive permissions.

- <a href="https://kubevious.io/docs/features/cloud-native-tools/capacity-planning-and-resource-usage-optimization/" target="_blank">Capacity Planning and Resource Usage Optimization</a>. Identify how much of cluster resources are used by Applications and Namespaces.

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Investigate
- <a href="https://kubevious.io/docs/features/time-machine/" target="_blank">Time Machine</a> lets you travel back in time, investigate cluster configuration and state, audit applications, root cause outages, and recover good and working manifests. Time Machine works by extracting resources directly from the Kubernetes API server, meaning that it keeps track of all changes, including ones made by k8s operators. 
![Kubevious Time Machine](https://kubevious.io/static/452c7f6c9960b3dedfd41baea7567ee6/3f20e/time-machine-active.png)

- <a href="https://kubevious.io/docs/features/search-engine/" target="_blank">Search Engine</a> is a like full-text search engine to find and return Kubernetes manifests matching various search criteria.
![Kubevious Search Engine](https://kubevious.io/static/d2f0c37d574441032aa8dfb57332d17f/3f20e/search-simple.png)

## üöí Troubleshoot
- <a href="https://kubevious.io/docs/features/health-monitoring/" target="_blank">App & Pod Health Monitoring</a> helps you troubleshoot degradations of Application health with intuitive built-in tools that direct you to the source of the problem.
