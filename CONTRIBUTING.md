# Contributing
Kubevious is an open-source project. We invite your participation through issues and pull requests! Everyone is welcome to participate, literally everyone (please see our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for details). Joining the Kubevious community should be fun and a great place to meet awesome people who share a mission to make Kubernetes easier and safer to operate.

## Ways you can help

### Use Kubevious!
First of all, try using Kubevious. What makes you like it? Do you have friends using Kubernetes in production? Let all of us know what you think tagging our Twitter handle <a href="https://twitter.com/kubevious" target="_blank">@kubevious</a>.

### Contributing to Product Code
We have requests for new features, suggestions, and bug fixes. Maybe you'd like to open a pull request to address one of them: [![Issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/kubevious/kubevious?color=red)](https://github.com/kubevious/kubevious/issues) 

### Contributing to Rules Library
Kubevious comes with a JavaScript-like rule language to extend validation logic and prevent misconfigurations & violations of best practices. We are building an open-source library of such rules. If you're hands-on with Kubernetes and have experience with production deployments, we would love to see your contribution to the [rules library](https://github.com/kubevious/rules-library).

### Kubernetes Experience
Are you a Kubernetes practitioner and using it daily? Have some ideas on making Kubernetes safe and easier to operate at scale? Maybe we would implement something in Kubevious to solve that. Let us know what you think in [Slack](https://kubevious.io/slack) or open a [new issue request](https://github.com/kubevious/kubevious/issues).
