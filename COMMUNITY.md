## Weekly Community Meeting
Kubevious contributors and users gather every Thursday @ 9 am PDT for a [Zoom call](https://us06web.zoom.us/j/84612326916?pwd=OWRjY21NL3RzWGd3czdEQTRuekt0Zz09). Everyone is welcome to join. During the call, we discuss:
- The current state of Kubevious
- Upcoming development items
- Any other community-relevant topics during the open session

If you want to discuss something during the next meeting's open session, you can let us know in the **#weekly-meeting** channel of our [Slack workspace](https://kubevious.io/slack).
